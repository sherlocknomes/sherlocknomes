### Hi Github, welcome to my Github. I'm a professional meme
### 
Catch me..

🎮 Gaming. I play all the mainstream games, but my true passion is indie switch games, so I have no money.

💻 Coding. Well this is Github. White hat hacker(for the most part).

🎹 Practicing piano. Help a short middle-aged woman forces me to do this every day pls send help

🙃 Panicking and calm at the same time.

⚽⛷️🧗 My main sports are soccer, skiing, and rock climbing. 

Active Idea: Among Us Bot (for desktop) that is controlled by the movements of my Roomba. Normal screen scrape for the most part 
except the crewmate goes wherever the Roomba goes. The only problem is, if it's impostor, it's gonna look kinda sus
